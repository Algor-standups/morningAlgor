You get passed a sorted array of positive intergers and a target number to find in the sorted array.
Output is the index of the target number in the sorted array.
If num is not in the array, return -1
Solve with a time complexity better than O(n).
const nums = [1, 4, 6, 7, 9, 17, 45]
findNumIndex(nums, 17);  -> 5
findNumIndex(nums, 8);  -> -1
