/*
205. Isomorphic Strings
https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/

Given two strings str1 and str2, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in str1 can be replaced to get str2.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order
of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

Example 1:
Input: str1 = "egg", str2 = "add"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: str1 = "foo", str2 = "bar"
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: str1 = "paper", str2 = "title"
Output: true


Note:
You may assume both str1 and str2 have the same length.
